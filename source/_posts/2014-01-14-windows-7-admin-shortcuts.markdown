A little trick to help you access all the administrative functions of Windows 7 with shortcuts.
All you need to do is create a folder on your desktop and rename it with the following name. 
```
yournamehere.{ed7ba470-8e54-465e-825c-99712043e01c}
```
For this example we will use "yournamehere" however you can use whatever name you would like in place of it.
After you create your folder and re-name it according to the example above you should have a folder that looks like the folowing picture.
